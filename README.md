## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### My Name is Juan
Discovered my passion for programming and Computer Science in general on April 27, 2022 when I made an Unreal Engine game. I likened it to a Cosmic Door in which once opened it can never be closed
and I entered in it and immediately fell in love with the world of Computing. In a way, it saved me from my instability that I experienced in Creative Writing as I found myself more expressive here
than I was there.

## What I am learning
Computer Science in general. As in generally, I have built a compiler, a bootloader, a database management system, a webbrowser, a text editor, an IDE, a face detector who could read emotions even before 
formally going into Computer Science. But what I am passionate is its utilization of mathematics. Which would further my goal in diving deep into Quantum Computing hence why I now code each and everyday
to practice and dive deeper in what I can do with this newly found passion of mine. And shifting from humanities has been the best decision of my life.

## How to navigate my repos and stuff
I named each of my repo prior to 2025 with a prefix Cleto_type_name or Cleto_name_type. Apologies in advanced if I mixed the two up but at any rate, there are two types of repos; project and practice.
If the repo name is Cleto_practice_name then it is a bunch of code that I used as practice either for school or for fun (personal reasons lol).
If the repo name is Cleto_project_name then it is a project, and most likely would include documentation on how to use the app and so on.

Note: repos before 2025 will not use this format.
